        Are you hungry?  I mean <em>really</em> hungry?  If so, we recommend you pick this dish!  Fluffy pancakes, eggs over easy,
         crispy bacon, refried beans, a heapin' mountain of fried potatoes, and an omlette with greens and red bell peppers.  
         Comes with a side of tomato and avacado (bleh)
