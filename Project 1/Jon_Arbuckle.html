    <p>
        Hello there!  I am <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>, most of you know my cat <strong>Garfield.</strong>
        My birthday is July 28th.  I am 29 years old,<em>  I should be 30 but I was sick for a year.</em>
        I am part Italian and have green eyes.  My favorite type of music is polka and enjoy
        playing music at home in Indiana.  I am very honest and timid but can be assertive at times.
    <br><br>
        The entertaining part of my life is with my cat <strong>Garfield</strong> and dog <strong>Odie.</strong>
        Garfield is fat and lazy with an attitude.  Odie is a loving dog without a brain.
        As entertaining as life is with these pets, these two drive me crazy!  However, I 
        can't imagine life without them.  These two are my family.
