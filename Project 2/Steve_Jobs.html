    <p>Steve Jobs was co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc.  He is considered to be a brilliant businessman, as well as a great tech visionary of our time.
    </p>
    <p>Steve Jobs has a fascinating story.  After dropping out of college, he partnered with his friend, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak" target="_blank">Steve Wozniac</a>
         to start Apple in 1967 at 21 years old.  
        The two gained a lot of fame and wealth a year later for the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II" target="_blank">Apple II.</a>  
        The Apple II was one of the first mass-produced personal computers.  Earlier in 1984, Macintosh was the first mass-produced computer with a GUI
        '(graphical user interface).'  After being ousted of Apple in 1985, he went on to oversee the creation of two new companies:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" target="_blank">NeXT</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar" target="_blank">Pixar</a>
        With the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve became a billionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1997 Steve returned to Apple.  Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the industry, and Apple was on the brink of extinction.  Nonetheless, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field" target="_blank">Steve was a fantastic salesman,</a>
        and used his business acumen to slowly bring the company back to profitability.
